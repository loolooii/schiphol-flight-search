# Assignment

Please create a simple single page application using vanilla JS which contains an input field. When the user enters at least three characters into this input field you should display all flight information from `flights.json` where the destination matches the entered input.

We think 4 hours should be enough to spend on this assignment. Please don't spend more than that unless you're having fun and want to show off :)

## Requirement:
- Use webpack to build es5 output of your program.
- Make it look nice, we provided some internal sass files in the sass directory from our internal setup - you can read about these on [ http://takeoff.schiphol.nl/component/style-fundamentals ] (make sure webpack is also packaging these styles)
- Your application should treat the contents of flights.json as the output of an API endpoint, it should load this via xhr and not require a page load when the user changes their input

## Submission:
- Create clone this repository locally. Then push it to your GitHub account and continue working from there. Once you have finished, please send us the URL of the repository you created.

### Some things to consider:
- We like tested code
- We like readable code
- We like using the latest features of ES6 where applicable
- Last but not least, have fun!
